System: Thanks for your patience, Marcus. Your email has been updated. Is there anything else I can do for you?
User: Actually, yes. I’m also looking into switching my internet provider. I’ve been having some issues with my current service. I’m thinking of going with SkyTech Solutions.
System: Ah, yes, SkyTech is a solid choice. Do they offer good speeds in your area?
