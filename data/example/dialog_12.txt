System: You're welcome! For this member’s policy, if the visit is billed as an office visit, the member will have a $50 copay per visit. The office visit copay is the only thing that applies to your Q code.
User: Okay.
System: The $50 copay does not apply to the out-of-pocket maximum. So the member will only be required to pay that $50 for an office visit.
